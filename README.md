# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio

Week 2

**What have I learnt this week?**

Introductory lesson into modules. Professor is a great sport, makes learning the topic very enjoyable, post this lesson I told members of my family about the case studies we learnt such as the finding of a ship missing in the atlantic and how, through the use modules and using the crowd, a team of people were able to locate a ship somewhere in the pacific ocean.

**What do I &#39;now know&#39; that I did not before?**

The general concept of modules is all around us, we are constantly surrounded by data modeling whether we realise it or not, and doing it ourselves subconsciously for that matter without realising it.

Modules are a great way to break down complex ideas, for example the case study of finding a rogue ship from &#39;somewhere&#39; in the ocean sounds like an impossible task but modeling and most importantly having the capability to create accurate modules. In the case study for example, finding the ship was only successful as the person put in charge of the team was a great modular and abided by the &#39;rules&#39; required for a module to be true of biases and other potential outline causes.

**What insights have I gained?**

Throughout this tutorial I have gained the &#39;modulers lens&#39;, a mental lens that has allowed me to realise this constantly occurring process. We live in such a fast-paced world that data analysis in itself holds such little processing times due to the influx of new arrays of data gushing in at any given moment, from the demands of our interconnected lives to the interpersonal interactions we have with the environment around us. Using modules allows us to slow all this down and actually put meaning to arrays of data that matter to us; allowing us to, as stated in this tutorial, to reveal in-depth analytical answers to interactions or questions we would&#39;ve perceived differently when analysed lightly.

**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**

Since this is the introductory tutorials I don&#39;t think that this question applies to the current week as we were just discussing concepts and ideas mainly.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**

Due to this being the second week, I did not have any team-related challenges that I encountered and the lessons in this course were very intriguing to me and I believe that I did not have difficulty understanding the concepts/ideas covered throughout this tutorial.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**

To get a better idea I would prefer to take a read of a course module prior to a tutorial in later weeks as some concepts delved into will be much better if I take a look for myself and familiarise myself then be famirliseed again when the professor goes through the tutorial during class time.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**

Not a theory but the use of REDCAPE is an excellent acronym to reinforce the usage of modules in the right way.

It reinforces the basic requirements of a proper module, and makes us keep in mind how easy it is to form biases and severe the intricacies of a module if these rules are violated.
