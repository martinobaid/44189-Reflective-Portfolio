# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio

Week 12

**What have I learnt this week?**

It&#39;s full-on assignment period at the moment. I&#39;m sure most other teams are also getting their hands on the assignment at this point since there isn&#39;t a whole lot of time left at this point. Overall I have learnt that, on a personal-level, this unit has been my most enjoyable, hands down. From the material, to the tutor and even the group members that I&#39;ve interacted with, all great chaps and really I guess this is what university is all about, doing stuff that you find interesting, some courses may not pique your interest but this one sure did, meeting new people and making connections that could quite possibly last a lifetime.

**What do I &#39;now know&#39; that I did not before?**

Well this week our tutor notified us of an extension towards the assignment, I&#39;m sure everyone welcomes an extension in time towards an assignment.

Week 10

**What have I learnt this week?**

There&#39;s not much content going on anymore since the class shifted into &quot;assignment completion mode&quot;. For me this week I looked into the feedback we were given on Github, the feedback from what I saw was in relation to our other teammates wherein the general consensus was we should add in more details in other parts and more high-level &#39;writing&#39; to flow through with other sections that were written.

**What insights have I gained?**

During this week our group discussed our plans for the assignment further and talked with our tutor, Juan, about it which is great news as always. I asked about gathering datasets and how that&#39;d work, got that cleared up which was great.

**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**

Well it&#39;s really interesting seeing how helpful our team leader was, of course we should all always be helping each other out but it is really intriguing on

Week 9

**What have I learnt this week?**

This week there wasn&#39;t any content really we&#39;re just focusing on the assignment. What I did like from this week was Jupyter Labs. It&#39;s a great piece of open source software that is literally an install away as an add-on to Python. I really enjoy the world of opensource and the public culture/backings of free, open source software, for everyone. It truly inspires many and I&#39;m sure in the years that we&#39;ve continuously pushed for such a culture, many products and services today wouldn&#39;t exist without it, and from what I see, its on track to continue, growing larger and larger.

**What do I &#39;now know&#39; that I did not before?**

Well as the assignment progresses I&#39;m not entirely sure on what to put into here as, quite frankly I haven&#39;t deeply delved into the assignment at this point but since we&#39;re asked to reflect generally, I could add in that it&#39;s been great so far with online university in terms of ease-of-access since it&#39;s a long-train ride for me but also what&#39;s nice is that our university is now recording lectures and tutorials which they weren&#39;t doing pre-Covid. Really interesting considering other universities have this standard pre-Covid.

**What insights have I gained?**

Well for me it

**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**

In general, Github, and the actual Git system behind it all is such an amazing piece of software, it really is interesting seeing how easy it is for someone who has never touched Git before can pick its basic concepts in a matter of minutes, getting behind a tool so powerful, enabling millions projects to access easy team collaboration and a superb &#39;changelog&#39; for the project wherein one can jump back and view every commit in a repository.

Week 8

**What have I learnt this week?**

This week some of our team members began utilizing Python, getting our git repo up and running and installing Jupyter as an extension from Python. In regards to in class material I believe soon we won&#39;t be covering as much content as in previous weeks as we transition into &#39;assignment focus&#39;. Regardless, this week we covered the Colonel Blotto Game and the Prisoner&#39;s dilemma.

**What do I &#39;now know&#39; that I did not before?**

The amount of topics that fall into the colonel Blotto Game is just another example of what I&#39;ve and also what Juan has been telling us since we entered this course and that is throughout this course, the concepts and what-not one learns helps them develop a new set of &#39;lense&#39; allowing them to apply their studies to the world around them. There were quite a few dot-points listed out there once again outlining the extend of broadness a given model, or strategy in this case can encapsulate, although when you do think about there is the realisation that &#39;broad&#39; here means &#39;broad&#39; fields as they actually do boil down certain characteristics that allow them to classify in this strategy in the first place.

**What insights have I gained?**

**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**

Week 7

**What have I learnt this week?**

Week 7, a week closer to the assignment...this week&#39;s tutorial covered the concepts of &#39;Complexity and emergent behaviours&#39;. An interesting topic delving into models that map out certain concepts such as segregation and peer effect modelling on a given populous.

**What do I &#39;now know&#39; that I did not before?**

The models covered in this week, and in their given topics were foreign to me, prior to this I don&#39;t believe I have ever been trindouced to topics such as the Gravonenters model which I think I&#39;ll be using as a model in the assignment.

**What insights have I gained?**

Well all these topics were very interesting to say the least. It&#39;s funny as I said something similar in a reflection weeks back in relation to these models and concepts that are occurring all around us and anyone has the ability to sit down, learn about these concepts and apply it all around them to where they fit appropriately. Really changes the outlook on things and our constantly evolving understanding of the world around us.

**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**

One of the perceived strengths was quite interesting is the nomination of a team leader. It&#39;s really interesting to see how, typically, when a person has been assigned that role they are more engaging with the group, pushing the group consntaly to continue and make progress.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**

Well a challenge for this week in regards to the assignment was selecting an appropriate topic to cover as part of the assignment and its investigative study.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**

As stated in the week before, I don&#39;t think there is any cause for concern or issues in regards to what could&#39;ve been done better. I&#39;m glad that we have chosen a topic and that I&#39;ve jotted down some models in my mind that will be useful, of which the, I believe it was called Gravonieetrs or Markov&#39;s model that looks interesting.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**

I really enjoyed learning today&#39;s topic converting units such as segregation and peer effects. The studies of racial discrimiation done in New York covered in a segment from this weeks unit on canvas was also quite interesting to see as it puts you yourself into a &#39;birds-eye&#39; view where you can really depict and absorb the concepts that&#39;s being taught to you by analysing real-life studies in regards to the topic of segregation for example. We also covered topics that were equally interesting such as the effects of coordination, culture, and social learning.

Week 6

**What have I learnt this week?**

I really just want to come out and say that this subject so far has been really, really, enjoyable. Just love it, very entertaining, great tutor, content is great to engage with and creating your own models looks very nice, especially with such diverse open-source software and communities, a person with no prior coding experience for example can easily hop on YouTube, follow a tutorial on a topic they like, say taking today&#39;s in-class topic of Markov&#39;s theory, grab a model from someone and run their own tests about, becoming an expert in no time!

**What do I &#39;now know&#39; that I did not before?**

Well, much like the other topics so far I&#39;m really enjoying learning new concepts that I haven&#39;t previously covered.

**What insights have I gained?**

Well throughout this tutorial we covered quite a few things, path dependance, rand walks, growth, broadcasting, diffusion, contagion, markov&#39;s process and equilibrum w/ function methods.

**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**

Well throughout this tutorial it was quite a long one but again it all boils down to your tutor, a percived strength that I&#39;ve seen throughout all these weeks is Juan&#39;s ability to keep the class engaged, exlpaijnming content in a consistent and engaging manner. Would&#39;ve been much better if it wasn&#39;t stuck to Zoom classes but again the travel distance is roughly 2 hours there and back so it is a compromise with clear advantages and disadvantages.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**

Throughout this week our teams are getting ready to organise a call or something in the likes of that as to taking our next steps towards the assignment, also as we get closer to the assignment date we will soon be installing prerequisites such as Jupyter Lab and Python to help us with the assignment. To be honest, there was no issues with our team as we haven&#39;t done anything substantial as of yet apart from team leader selection.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**

As stated in the week before, I don&#39;t think there is any cause for concern or issues in regards to what could&#39;ve been done better.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**

I really enjoyed learning about the Markov processes. It&#39;s a great theorem in regards to modelling the likelihood of an event to shift states and the worked examples that are available for example on Canvas really explain it well as well as the tutorial of course.

Week 5

**What have I learnt this week?**

Week 5 was also quite interesting for me,

**What do I &#39;now know&#39; that I did not before?**

After being introduced to these three new models last week, Juan now introduced us to new concepts such as system dynamics and the feedback loops curated by such systems. The concept of networking was also delved into which is, like all the other units in this subject so far, were quite interesting. I guess a large component leading up to this experience I&#39;ve had is we haven&#39;t learnt these types of concepts prior in say highschool and it really is knowledge that is affecting us everyday yet if you don&#39;t attend the tutorials and what-not you won&#39;t have the &#39;lens&#39; to &#39;see through it&#39;; these concepts won&#39;t be known to you.

**What insights have I gained?**

Well, as stated above I&#39;ve gained insight about concepts that otherwise were not known to me and understanding these concepts will surely help buffer my understanding when assignments and other practical workings come along wherein I need to apply these models and skills to better lead our studies.

**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**

In the next few weeks assignments and group tasks will start ramping up so until then I really am not sure as to what to put into these questions here. The overall topic this week was interesting. Although this week we did see group finalisation. I guess the one little observation that could&#39;ve been acted on was after the team leader was finalised we could&#39;ve discussed further about the assignment but to be fair there is quite some more time so discussing further today won&#39;t really matter much as it only takes a few minutes to do really and is one call or discussion away.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**

I am thankfully happy with my team, the only little note I had, which I did state above was we could&#39;ve discussed further after finalising a team member, but neither is it crucial or will it change anything as we will naturally discuss it in due time, so really no biggie there. I&#39;m thankful that I have a group with a member that I&#39;ve previously done tasks with before so not all of them are unknown to me which is great. Also do believe I saw one of them at one of the very few times we went to UTS in the first semester prior to COVID shifting classes online.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**

Week 4

**What have I learnt this week?**

Week 4 was quite interesting for me, during this week Juan began taking us through system dynamics, networking and modelling; the next step to last weeks lesson which, as a quick recap, was about the models of thinking. Of which there were three; rational, behavioral and rule-based thinking.

**What do I &#39;now know&#39; that I did not before?**

After being introduced to these three new models last week, Juan now introduced us to new concepts such as system dynamics and the feedback loops curated by such systems. The concept of networking was also delved into which is, like all the other units in this subject so far, were quite interesting. I guess a large component leading up to this experience I&#39;ve had is we haven&#39;t learnt these types of concepts prior in say highschool and it really is knowledge that is affecting us everyday yet if you dont study this subject you won&#39;t have the &#39;lens&#39; to &#39;see through it&#39;.

**What insights have I gained?**

Well, as stated above I&#39;ve gained insight about concepts that otherwise were not known to me and understanding these concepts will surely help buffer my understanding when assignments and other practical workings come along wherein I need to apply these models and skills to better lead our studies.

**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**

Well, this question is a sort of weird one for me really, the topic was great, our tutor was great at explaining and really makes the class an enjoyable learning environment, thus my first, I guess, weakness, emerges, I would&#39;ve loved to personally chat and get to know my tutors and peers, although that would again mean that I&#39;d have to account for the roughly two hour train ride there and back, I don&#39;t mind it if its a topic I like, and this subject sure is turning out to be exactly that!

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**

This week wasn&#39;t much different from the rest, we covered interesting topics which I liked understanding, asking questions in class is always great, especially when we have such a great tutor!

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**

Well, I&#39;m not entirely sure on what to say for this week, maybe in the later weeks if I have difficulty with the content I&#39;ll need to put more time to help understand and ask my fellow peers or tutor for help where need-be.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**

Well if this is in reference to the topics covered today, I really enjoyed learning about Agent-based modelling, apart from it sounding really interesting, it was also interesting to learn. By harnessing the power of computer simulations which we are doing globally on an ever-increasing scale the amount of learning that can be done dosen&#39;t have to be confined to a single &#39;person&#39;, computers, from what I understand, can run arrays of simulations, simultaneously and rack up tens, hundreds, thousands and really beyond, of simulation hours on a given topic. One that is impossible for a person to achieve in a single sitting.

Week 3

What have I learnt this week?

The process of modeling complex systems can be a very difficult undertaking especially if the core components of the model involve or rely on humans as we are very hard to judge on a rational and interpersonal scale due to the vast amount of influences, belief structures and other factors that influence us on a running basis. Thus, to make modelling easier we are told to factor in these.

What do I &#39;now know&#39; that I did not before?

There are a multitude of ways to converse in, or undertake an analysis of a model for just about anything that exists around us, sure some tasks may be near impossible but they can still be modelled to a degree. Further, there are a multitude of ways to even model one thing, for example the use of a spatial choice modeling system to objectively define with burger is better, Mc&#39;Donalds or Burger King, there are key differentiating factors such as the differences in pickles and tomatoes breaking or making ones rating over each product on a case-to-case basis.

What insights have I gained?

It was really eye-opening to see the various impacts and value adding a team member such as those on the rowing team have, the coxswain seemingly has the easiest job but is actually crucial to the teams success, without the coxswain there will be an imbalance on the raft. This was proven through modeling and defining a Shapley value, in all cases, having a coxswain regardless of rankings meant that the team performed worse-off and placed in a slower bracket than those with a coxswain.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I really enjoyed learning about the power of working together and defining Shapley values to the creativity and ingenuity of one&#39;s ideas when generating ideas in a team-work environment. By utilizing such factors we are able to model-out and thus evaluate and evolve certain ideas that the team mutually agreed on all-in-all allowing us to achieve much more refined and better-suited solutions towards the problem at-hand. I personally love team-work and this piece of information will prove useful to my future team-working endeavours.

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

There was no team working this week.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

There was no team working this week.

What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

Overall, the assigning of Shapley values and in general, the usage of Shapley values is an interesting undertaking as it can broadly be used in all activities that we accomplish on a daily-basis.

The most eye-opening segment came at the conclusion on Shapley values wherein the module outlined that &quot;in thinking about the value of corporations or other multinational organisations, Shapley value may be a better measure.&quot;

I definitely agree with the statement above and think that is a useful and great way at summarising the power of Shapley values on an unprecedented scale for the world around us, not limited to our models and small use-cases.

Week 2

**What have I learnt this week?**

Introductory lesson into modules. Professor is a great sport, makes learning the topic very enjoyable, post this lesson I told members of my family about the case studies we learnt such as the finding of a ship missing in the atlantic and how, through the use modules and using the crowd, a team of people were able to locate a ship somewhere in the pacific ocean.

**What do I &#39;now know&#39; that I did not before?**

The general concept of modules is all around us, we are constantly surrounded by data modeling whether we realise it or not, and doing it ourselves subconsciously for that matter without realising it.

Modules are a great way to break down complex ideas, for example the case study of finding a rogue ship from &#39;somewhere&#39; in the ocean sounds like an impossible task but modeling and most importantly having the capability to create accurate modules. In the case study for example, finding the ship was only successful as the person put in charge of the team was a great modular and abided by the &#39;rules&#39; required for a module to be true of biases and other potential outline causes.

**What insights have I gained?**

Throughout this tutorial I have gained the &#39;modulers lens&#39;, a mental lens that has allowed me to realise this constantly occurring process. We live in such a fast-paced world that data analysis in itself holds such little processing times due to the influx of new arrays of data gushing in at any given moment, from the demands of our interconnected lives to the interpersonal interactions we have with the environment around us. Using modules allows us to slow all this down and actually put meaning to arrays of data that matter to us; allowing us to, as stated in this tutorial, to reveal in-depth analytical answers to interactions or questions we would&#39;ve perceived differently when analysed lightly.

**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**

Since this is the introductory tutorials I don&#39;t think that this question applies to the current week as we were just discussing concepts and ideas mainly.

**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**

Due to this being the second week, I did not have any team-related challenges that I encountered and the lessons in this course were very intriguing to me and I believe that I did not have difficulty understanding the concepts/ideas covered throughout this tutorial.

**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**

To get a better idea I would prefer to take a read of a course module prior to a tutorial in later weeks as some concepts delved into will be much better if I take a look for myself and familiarise myself then be famirliseed again when the professor goes through the tutorial during class time.

**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**

Not a theory but the use of REDCAPE is an excellent acronym to reinforce the usage of modules in the right way.

It reinforces the basic requirements of a proper module, and makes us keep in mind how easy it is to form biases and severe the intricacies of a module if these rules are violated.
